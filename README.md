# Titanic-Dataset-Preprocessing-and-Feature-Engineering-Project
This project preprocesses the Titanic dataset for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical data, and engineering new features like Title and FamilySize. It transforms raw data into a clean, normalized, and enriched format for predictive modeling.
